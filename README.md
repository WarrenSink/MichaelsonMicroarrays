# MichaelsonMicroarrays
Exposing cells to the environmental contaminant benzo-[a]-pyrene activates the AhR and causes toxic stress resulting in transcriptional changes that are not regulated by the AhR. Using multiple doses and timepoints from BaP exposure, Michaelson *et al.* measured microarray gene expression (n=3) in the murine liver cell line Hepa1c1c7.
